ðŸ•’ Initial Requirements Gathering: Digital Clock Project
1. Project Objective
"Can you describe the purpose of the digital clock project? Is it for home use, educational, commercial, or embedded in another system like IoT or Arduino?"

2. Key Features Requested
Some examples to consider:
- Time display format: 12-hour, 24-hour, or both?
- Include date and day?
- Alarm or stopwatch functionality?
- Brightness adjustment?
- Battery backup or power options?
3. Display Type Preference
"Do you have a preference for the displayâ€”LED, LCD, OLED, or a custom touchscreen interface?"

4. Integration or Platform
"Should the clock be built on a microcontroller like Arduino or Raspberry Pi, or is it a software application for desktop/mobile/web?"

5. Design Constraints
Letâ€™s clarify:
- Size or dimensions
- Budget range
- Deadline/timeline
- Target users (e.g., children, elderly, hobbyists)
6. Optional Advanced Features
Would they be interested in:
- Syncing with internet time servers (NTP)?
- Bluetooth or Wi-Fi connectivity?
- Voice control or smart assistant integration?
7. Visual & User Interface Preferences
"Any ideas on color scheme, layout, or buttons? Should the interface be touch-based or controlled via external switches?"

8. Deliverables Expected
"Would you like a complete product with casing or just the circuit and code? Should documentation be included for future reference or education?"
